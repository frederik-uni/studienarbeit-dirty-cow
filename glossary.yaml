  long: Random Access Memory
  description: is the computer’s primary volatile working memory used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs in the short term. RAM enables fast read/write access for running programs and active processes; its contents are lost when power is removed.

  long: Central Processing Unit
  description: is the primary processing component of a computer that executes program instructions and controls system operations. It performs arithmetic and logical operations, manages control flow, and coordinates with memory and peripherals to run processes and threads.
pte:
  short: PTE
  article: the
  long: Page Table Entry
  description: is an entry in a process’s page table that maps a virtual memory page to a physical page frame and encodes access permissions and status flags. A PTE typically contains the physical frame reference and metadata such as present, read/write, user/supervisor, accessed, dirty, and (architecture-dependent) execute-disable attributes.
